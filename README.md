- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd caskxexchange/front-end
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or

```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

## Project Structure

The project follows Next.js App Router pattern with a modular structure:

```
src/
├── app/                  # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── (auth)/           # Authentication routes (sign-in, sign-up)
│   ├── (root)/           # Main public-facing routes
│   ├── admin/            # Admin dashboard routes
│   ├── api/              # API routes
│   └── user/             # User account routes
├── assets/               # Static assets (images, styles)
├── components/           # React components
│   ├── shared/           # Domain-specific components
│   └── ui/               # Reusable UI components
├── config/               # Configuration files
├── lib/                  # Utility functions, constants
├── services/             # API services
└── types/                # TypeScript types
```

## Authentication System

The application uses NextAuth.js for authentication:

- Supports credential-based authentication
- JWT-based session management
- Role-based access control
- Protected routes in middleware

Authentication flow:

1. User signs in through `/sign-in` page
2. Credentials are validated
3. JWT token is created and stored
4. Protected routes check authentication status via middleware

## Component Architecture

The component structure follows a clear separation of concerns:

### UI Components (`/components/ui/`)

Generic, reusable components that form the building blocks of the UI. These components are styled with Tailwind CSS and follow the principles of the Shadcn UI component library.

Examples:

- Button
- Card
- Dialog
- Input

### Shared Components (`/components/shared/`)

Domain-specific components that are used across the application. These are organized by feature area:

- `/admin/` - Components used in the admin dashboard
- `/auth/` - Authentication forms and related components
- `/header/` - Navigation and header components
- `/user/` - User profile and settings components

## Styling

The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling:

- Utility-first CSS framework
- Custom theme configuration in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Global styles in `src/assets/styles/globals.css`
- Dark mode support via `next-themes`

## State Management

For state management, the application uses:

- React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- React Context for global UI state
- React Hook Form for form state management

## Testing

The project uses Jest for testing:

- Run tests: `npm test` or `yarn test`
- Watch mode: `npm run test:watch` or `yarn test:watch`

Tests are configured in `jest.config.ts` and `jest.setup.ts`.

## Deployment

The application is designed to be deployed on Vercel:

1. Build the application: `npm run build` or `yarn build`
2. Start the production server: `npm start` or `yarn start`

For detailed deployment instructions, see the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying).

## Git Workflow

When contributing to this project, follow these git practices:

1. Create a feature branch from `main`
2. Make your changes with descriptive commit messages
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. Ensure all tests pass before merging
